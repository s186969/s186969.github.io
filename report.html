                    <h3>Simple Webpage</h3>
                    <p>We have for this assignment decided to do these things in order to improve 
                        navigability of our page for both search engines and human users.</p>
                    <h4>Changes made</h4>
                    <p>After checking our website with A-checker, we discovered we had to change our headers. 
                        This because it did not like multiple &lth1&gt tags in a single page. Changed headers 
                        for subpages to &lth2&gt tags, added CSS rules to make &lth2&gt headers achieve similar 
                        visual result. There were also html problems with &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt inside a &ltaddress&gt tag. 
                        This was the case for the footer so changed the position the headers. A small mistake 
                        was also made with the alt for the &ltimg&gt tag on “About” section. Added the alt 
                        “Old Irish fishers”, the only &ltimg&gt tag that was missing the alt attribute. </p>
                    <p>We also did our own investigation in order to improve our site.</p>  
                    <p>In the far late development of our site, we discovered that the contents were aligned 
                        in a different position when we worked at home. This was due to that when we first 
                        designed our site, all the contents were aligned to fit on a screen with an aspect 
                        ratio of 3:2 from our laptop. We came upon to discover that all the contents were 
                        stretched out on our 16:9 screen at our home.  We somehow found a workaround this 
                        issue involving locking our contents with a fixed width and height and filling the 
                        background black.</p> 
                    <p>Due to the content were stretched, that also led to another issue. To begin with, 
                        we had a saturated photo that was our background image with white fonts. The fonts 
                        were positioned in the highest contrasted area of the image. However, since the 
                        position of the fonts were stretched, they moved to the lowest contrasted area of 
                        the image, making it diffucult to read. To solve this, we had to change the image 
                        and colour it green.</p>
                    <p>In hindsight, we would like to improve the site by adding media query to make our 
                        site more responsive for mobile phones. We would also like to improve the site 
                        for screen reading, as it only reads the navigation bar for the moment.</p>
