Relevant comment for Adaré homepage:

The Adare’s webpage is contained with one main page that is divided into five sections. On the top of the webpage the user can select which sections of the website they want to explore. 
The navigation field at the top is pinned so that its always obtainable and it directs the user directly to Home, About, Menu, Gallery and Contact us section of the website.
The six menue is for the evaluator.
 
Home: Brings the user to the home page (back to the top). Here the user can easily see the restaurants theme, openings hours, address and the user has the option 
to make a reservation by clicking on the “Make a reservation” button. (Be aware: The button refers the you to a Rick Astley video from Youtube)

About: A general description about the restaurant.

Menu: This section of the webpage displays Adare’s dishes that are categorized into three courses. Each of the dishes contains allergies too. 

Gallery: Few photos from Adare that the user can see.

Contact us: Contains information that user can use to contact us.

Report: Contains the report that was necessary for this task.

Further on, a user with disabilities can use screen reader and navigate through with the tab and space button. However, it’s not fully functional. 
At this part the screen reader only selects and reads out the different menus on the navigation field, and it doesn’t return back to the navigation 
field when user has selected through all the menus.
